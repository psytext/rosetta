\usage{
posthocTGH(y, x, method = c("games-howell", "tukey"),
  conf.level = 0.95, digits = 2, p.adjust = "none",
  formatPvalue = TRUE)

\method{print}{posthocTGH}(x, digits = x$input$digits, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{y has to be a numeric vector.}

\item{x}{x has to be vector that either is a factor or can be converted into
one.}

\item{method}{Which post-hoc tests to conduct. Valid values are "tukey" and
"games-howell".}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level of the confidence intervals.}

\item{digits}{The number of digits to show in the output.}

\item{p.adjust}{Any valid \code{\link{p.adjust}} method.}

\item{formatPvalue}{Whether to format the p values according to APA
standards (i.e. replace all values lower than .001 with '<.001'). This only
applies to the printing of the object, not to the way the p values are
stored in the object.}

\item{\dots}{Any additional arguments are passed on to the `print` function.}
}
\value{
A list of three elements: \item{input}{List with input arguments}
\item{intermediate}{List of intermediate objects.} \item{output}{List with
two objects 'tukey' and 'games.howell', containing the outcomes for the
respective post-hoc tests.}
}
\description{
This function is used by the 'oneway' function for oneway analysis of
variance in case a user requests post-hoc tests using the Tukey or
Games-Howell methods.
}
\note{
This function is based on a file that was once hosted at
http://www.psych.yorku.ca/cribbie/6130/games_howell.R, but has been removed
since. It was then adjusted for implementation in the
\code{\link{userfriendlyscience}} package. Jeffrey Baggett needed the
confidence intervals, and so emailed them, after which his updated function
was used. In the meantime, it appears Aaron Schlegel
(\url{https://rpubs.com/aaronsc32}) independently developed a version with
confidence intervals and posted it on RPubs at
\url{https://rpubs.com/aaronsc32/games-howell-test}.

Also, for some reason, \code{p.adjust} can be used to specify additional
correction of \emph{p} values. I'm not sure why I implemented this, but I'm
not entirely sure it was a mistake either. Therefore, in
\code{userfriendlyscience} version 0.6-2, the default of this setting
changed from \code{"holm"} to \code{"none"} (also see
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/83941/games-howell-post-hoc-test-in-r).

### Compute post-hoc statistics using the tukey method
posthocTGH(y=ChickWeight$weight, x=ChickWeight$Diet, method="tukey");
### Compute post-hoc statistics using the games-howell method
posthocTGH(y=ChickWeight$weight, x=ChickWeight$Diet);
